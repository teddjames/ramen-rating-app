# Ramen Rater

Ramen Rater is a web project that lets you rate ramen dishes entirely from scratch. This project is designed to help you practice handling user events, manipulating the DOM, structuring JavaScript code effectively, and using Git basics. All data used in the project is static, so there's no need for server communication or external APIs.
